# Cambridge Maths Part III Essay -- Generative Adversarial Networks
For Cambridge Part III, there was the option to write an essay reviewing several papers as a substitute for an exam. One of these options was to write an essay on GANs, and I decided taking it since it was the only real opportunity to do anything which involved with deep neural nets within that course.

The essay was written with a mathematical perspective and reviewed the original papers on GANs by Ian Goodfellow, in addition to several other results hosted in the blog "Off the Convex Path".
However,  for demonstration purposes, I also coded up some simple GANs which can learn simple distributions and GANS. 

This repo is a fork of the original repository which hosted the code anonymously. The essays had to be submitted without any identifiers to avoid examiner bias. 
Since that is no longer an issue, I am migrating that code over to my named GitHub alongside with document containing my essay for posterity. Furthermore, there have been some more novel developments over at Off the Convex Path, and this code will allow me to start experimenting with that.
